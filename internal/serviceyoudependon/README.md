# Service You Depend On

This package should be renamed to any services that you need to call (depend on it).

For example, this project depend to bussiness-service, so this folder should be renamed to bussinessservice

*Notes: For folder's name should not written with dash (-). Golang doesn't support package name with dash (-) in the source code.
